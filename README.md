# CS370FinalProject - Flight Delay risk prediction app 
An app where users can enter their flight number and receive predictions on possible delays hours in advance as opposed to airports/airlines' last minute report on delays that you may not expect. There will be an option to see a detailed review of the causes of the delay and our confidence level for this data.
