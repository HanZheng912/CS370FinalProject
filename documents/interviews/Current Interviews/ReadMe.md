# This new discovery phase focused on understanding how travelers decide when to leave for the airport and the challenges they face in making that decision. User interviews were conducted to learn how people currently estimate travel time, what factors cause uncertainty, and why they sometimes arrive too early or miss flights.

The purpose of this phase was to identify user pain points and expectations in order to shape an application that helps users determine an appropriate departure time for the airport.
